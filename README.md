# Exploring-Chicago-Crime-Data-using-PySpark

**Project Overview:**

This project involves the exploration and analysis of Chicago crime data using Apache PySpark. The goal is to gain insights into reported crimes in Chicago by applying various PySpark functions and DataFrame APIs. The dataset used in this project is the Chicago crime reported data obtained from the Chicago Data Portal.

**Project Structure:**

Data Exploration: Explored the Spark environment, and different types of data frames, and applied PySpark functions to understand the dataset.
Data Analysis: Utilized DataFrame APIs, performed joins, and applied PySpark functions to analyze the dataset.

Research Questions: 
**Addressed the following research questions:**
Find the percentage of reported crimes that resulted in arrest.
Find the top 3 locations for reported crimes.
Find the most frequently reported non-criminal activity.
Find the day of the week with the most reported crime.

**Dataset:**
The Chicago crime reported data contains information about reported crimes in Chicago, including the type of crime, location, date, and whether an arrest was made.

Research Questions Explored:
Percentage of Reported Crimes Resulting in Arrest:

Analyzed the dataset to calculate the percentage of reported crimes that resulted in arrests.
Top 3 Locations for Reported Crimes:

Identified and ranked the top three locations where reported crimes occurred most frequently.
Most Frequently Reported Non-Criminal Activity:

Identified the most frequently reported non-criminal activity in the dataset.
Day of the Week with Most Reported Crime:

Analyzed the dataset to determine the day of the week with the highest number of reported crimes.

**Technologies Used:**
Apache PySpark
Python

**Conclusion:**
Through this project, we gained valuable insights into Chicago crime data using PySpark. By applying various PySpark functions and DataFrame APIs, we were able to answer research questions related to reported crimes, arrest percentages, crime locations, non-criminal activities, and the day of the week with the most reported crimes.

**Future Work:**
Explore additional analysis techniques and visualizations to gain deeper insights into Chicago crime data.
Incorporate machine learning models for predictive analysis and crime pattern recognition.
